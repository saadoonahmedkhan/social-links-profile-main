## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (with jQuery)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of responsive design and styling interactive elements with CSS. Additionally, working with jQuery improved my ability to manipulate the DOM efficiently.

```css
.button:hover {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to continue refining my skills in:

- Enhancing accessibility features
- Implementing additional animations for a smoother user experience
- Exploring alternative libraries for DOM manipulation

### Useful Resources
